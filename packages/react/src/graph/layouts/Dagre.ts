  // dagre algo options, uses default value on undefined

  acyclicer: undefined, // If set to 'greedy', uses a greedy heuristic for finding a feedback arc set for a graph.
  // A feedback arc set is a set of edges that can be removed to make a graph acyclic.

  spacingFactor: undefined, // Applies a multiplicative factor (>0) to expand or compress the overall area that the nodes take up
  nodeDimensionsIncludeLabels: false, // whether labels should be included in determining the space used by a node
  sort: undefined, // a sorting function to order the nodes and edges; e.g. function(a, b){ return a.data('weight') - b.data('weight') }
  // because cytoscape dagre creates a directed graph, and directed graphs use the node order as a tie breaker when
  // defining the topology of a graph, this sort function can help ensure the correct order of the nodes/edges.
  // this feature is most useful when adding and removing the same nodes and edges multiple times in a graph.
